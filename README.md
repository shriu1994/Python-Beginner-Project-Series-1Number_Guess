Number_Guess
Short Notes

1) It is going to be simple guessing game where the computer will generate a random number and the user has to guess it.

2) Based on Users input, computer gives hints to user whether given number is higher or lower than actual guess number.

we have 3 conditional statements.
1) if the guess is less than the required generated  number if this statement evaluates to true, we print the corresponding Guess.

2) Similarly, we check if the guess is greater than the generated number. So, we prompt users to that "Guess umber is higher than required guess."

3) The final if statement has the break keyword, which will terminate the loop entirely, So when the guess is equal to the generated number loop gets terminated.
